height data: kartverket, hoydedata.no

format:
sections are exported as GeoTIFF, and for each tile x there are the following files:

    x.tif               the heightmap itself
    x.tif.ovr           overview (3 thumbnails of differing size on separate layers)
    x.tif.aux.xml       geodata and statistics, eg. min and max height, histogram etc.
    x.tfw               world file, describes the location, scale and rotation
    x.sos               SOSI-format file, metadata

the value of a pixel seems to correspond 1:1 to the height in meters.

"I was able to find an alternative Java imaging library called Apache Commons Imaging. 
It is a pure-Java library that consists of a single small JAR file. 
It also supports both reading and writing of the TIFF file format and 
it has built-in support for GeoTIFF tags. It appears to handle all of 
the common compression formats as well."
    -> doesnt seem to support 32bit floating point gamma.

    -> geotools.org, gt-geotiff
        -> didnt work with my tiff files.... threw DataSourceException

JAI works, but:
maven fails to resolve JAI, _unless_ I add geotools repo and install it.
it seems to pull JAI in as a dependency.
    -> yes indeed, http://download.osgeo.org/webdav/geotools has JAI
